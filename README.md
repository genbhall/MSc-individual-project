Description
Context
This research proposal will contribute towards developing applications in the area of IoT for smart homes to prolong independent living for the aging population. There is strong potential for impact and societal benefit. For example, a study by AgeUK in 2010 found that up to one in three (3.4m) over 65s suffer a fall each year, costing the NHS an estimated £4.6 million a day. In addition, the research aligns with the UK government’s Industrial Strategy which features an “Ageing Society” Grand Challenge that seeks to “Ensure that people can  enjoy at least 5 extra healthy, independent years of life by 2035.”

Anomaly detection, aka outlier detection or novelty detection, refers to finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behaviour. Anomaly detection is popular in domains such as fraud detection, network intrusion, image processing etc. In recent years, anomaly detection has been popular for smart home technology to prolong independent living and enhance quality of life in the aging population by identifying opportune moments for healthcare interventions. Existing research considers traditional approaches such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) etc. and deep-learning based methods such as Long Short Term Memory (LTSM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) etc. Notably, the data sets used to evaluate these computational methods are different so it is difficult to comparatively analyse their performance.

Objectives
This research aims to carry out a comparative study of traditional and deep learning methods for anomaly detection for detecting imminent critical health events. This involves:
Reviewing existing literature on anomaly detection for independent living

Implementing a test bed for evaluating the performance of the traditional and deep learning anomaly-based computational methods.

Evaluate the performance of existing algorithms on benchmark datasets.


Methods
Traditional methods to be explored will include DBSCAN, KNN, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Deep-learning based methods will include LSTM and CNN.

Data Sets
The experiments will be carried out using publicly available CASAS datasets, available from the Centre for Advanced Adaptive Systems, Washington State University. These datasets contain the Active Daily Living (ADL) of both individual and group occupants. Activities included include sleeping eating, bathing, dressing, toileting etc.
